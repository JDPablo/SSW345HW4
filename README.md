I had a relatively difficult time completing this assignment. The languages and concepts used were unfamiliar to me, but I did learn a lot about what goes into a server and an API through completing it. Luckily, I had a lot of time to figure the concepts out, especially with the help of the lab assignment that we did last week. From then, a lot of my time was spent debugging and trying to figure out why my test cases wouldn't pass, which I resolved by noting the issues present in the test script itself ("master" branch instead of "main" branch, for example). Now, I have a more solid understanding of both REST and GitHub, and it was cool to see the two interact with each other.\
